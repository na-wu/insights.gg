### Thought process:
1. Read up on the Dogs.ceo API
2. Read up on Drag and Drop implementation in React
3. Decided that given time constraints, using a library would be most efficient (Material-UI)
4. Ran into CORS issues when retrieving data from API (My fault, issues resolved)
5. Successfully retrieved data from API, wrote simple algorithm to ensure ```breed``` uniqueness
6. Researched React DnD libraries - Chose one provided by Atlassian
7. Followed the tutorial in Atlassian Documentation
8. Realized that the tutorial lacked functionality that I needed
9. Found basic Drag and Drop example and built additional functionality off that foundation
10. Added functionality to Download as JSON button (pretty simple)
11. Researched UI/UX best practices
12. Tested and fixed minor bugs with some minor design changes
13. Seeked UI feedback and made adjusments accordingly

### Challenges:
1. Admittedly, aesthetics are not my strongest point. Finding and picking the correct color pallete was challenging and required a lot of time and effort. I am still not sure I am 100% satisfied with the pallette I chose.
2. JavaScript syntax. Although I mainly used JS in my previous internship, I was completely new to the language before that, and am still improving.

### Final Remarks:
1. This challenge was an amazing learning experience! I have always been weaker at Front End Development than Back end, and being able to build a small application really helped with solidifying my understanding of certain concepts.

### Getting Started
To get the React application server running locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install` to install required dependencies
3. `yarn start` to build database migrations
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to access the demo
